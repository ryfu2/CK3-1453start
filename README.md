# CK3-1453start
This repo stores the souce codes for a mod I created for Crusader King III. The mod aims to set up a 1453 start for the game.

Currently the mod is still very much under development, due to the fact that it can be very challenging and time consuming to find all the counts and dukes on the map at 1453. I might try to update it eventually, but eventually.
